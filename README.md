# Mission Statement:
Making a compelling piece of media challenging the possibility of what can be made in ten days. Pushing limits of narrative possibilities to match those of Naughty Dog, with a soundtrack which is more memorable than Marios, and graphic fidelity to make this the new "Crisis" of our era.

# Back of Box Description:
Step into the shoes of John McAfee, a visionary tech entrepreneur whose innovations reshaped the global landscape. Retired and residing in the picturesque island nation of Belize, life takes a sinister turn when your neighbor is discovered lifeless, and you find yourself unjustly implicated in the tragedy. Can you navigate the treacherous waters surrounding the island and evade capture, ultimately securing passage to the sun-drenched haven of Miami, Florida? Or will you succumb to the relentless pursuit of justice, facing interrogation and incarceration? Your fate hangs in the balance as you confront formidable adversaries on your quest for liberation. Only you can defy the odds and reclaim your freedom amidst the gripping twists and turns that lie ahead.

# Developer Diaries:
4/28/24 - Each member of the dream team of CS41 posted a commit on GitHub, while also coming to an agreement on a hard cap for the due date of Thursday, 5/2/24. This ensures that integration team members have time to focus on integration, conduct the beta test of the game, and squash all bugs.

4/29/24 - Each member dipped their toe in the water regarding their assigned role, spending the day learning and making commits to their repository of demo code or even just writing out concepts of what they want to do. This is helping each member to better understand and estimate the work that needs to be done for the Thursday deadline.

4/30/24 - Everyone is starting to focus and putting functional code into their files as we, as a team, start to grasp what we need to get done. We're also working on finishing the narrative script part of the game, as the script will lay the foundation for gameplay in the future.

5/1/24 - The group undertook position changes to better optimize workflow with different members' schedules. Caicedo and Li switched positions, with Li becoming JJK Curse Lord and Caicedo becoming Taste Tester. This will help us to even complete our goal faster.

5/2/24 - The inheritance class has been heavily worked on and uploaded to Git, laying out the groundwork for upcoming integration. It's not fully done, but good enough to understand what lies ahead for integration.

5/3/24 - As the challenge of the project rises, the group laid out the basic functions to make it a minimal viable product (MVP). We scaled down the project but increased the number of commits to Git. The UI team is meticulously working on getting it to work.
