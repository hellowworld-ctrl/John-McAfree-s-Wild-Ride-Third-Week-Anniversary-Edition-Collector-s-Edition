He lies comfortably by the poolside, one hand stroking the chin of his lover, and the other massaging the cold steel of his Smith & Wesson revolver. Belizean heat scorches his patchy blond hair and kisses the woefully tanned tribal tattoos on both shoulders. A mind once preoccupied with malware prevention and proprietary software now faces the incessant jitters of death or, even worse, jail time. He is surrounded by a sort of impromptu paramilitary, whose faces speak of blind loyalty. 


John McAfee:  a senior-aged mastermind in the art of evasion. He now assumes the role of virus, with few escapes remaining on an ever dwindling horizon. By this point, he has laid sovereignty on his small coastal abode in Ambergris Cave, enforcing curfews on the town’s helpless citizens. In true libertarian ethos, McAfee lies paranoid in a home devoid of a single tax document, contemplating a method of escape. Miami appears promising. 

“The airport - sounds like the only way out of here” McAfee’s little militant says. 

“We can try. The Fed has scoped the whole coast. More feds than a Lockeed Martin conference.” McAfee says, shaking through sips of scotch. 

“I’m scared, Johnny.” mutters his underaged girlfriend. 

“Why?”
